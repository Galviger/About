Hi, I'm Galviger.
I'm a lazy programmer, who only learns things he needs to at the moment.
My current projects are all focused on password grabbing, myself and my consenting friends, of course
Once I finish a project, I will post it here for you to download.
I make projects in python, but also in other languages, when I need to.
If you have any project ideas, comment them somewhere, I'd love to have some more projects to work on.
